## 🍸gin-gin🍸

gin-gin is a playground for me to implement some kinds of cool 😎 features in cloud native and a good practice for what I have learnt 
about **Design Pattern** and **Programming Engineering**. The project name "gin-gin" comes from using the Web Framework [GIN](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), and I have no idea what will be
the better choice.

## 📖 TODO-LIST
- [ ] gRPC calls To other seperate componets to make more complex Data Stream.
- [ ] More backend storage instances should be provided. (Redis as Cache, or some in-memory implementation in local; MongoDB | MySQL as persistent storage)
- [ ] Open-Policy-Agent advanced usage should be added in. (Maybe we can get a auto-configure support (via pull-or-push) or generator for policy generation)
- [ ] Using eBPF to do some interesting experiments.
- [ ] CI/CD support should be considered.
- [ ] Comments and Docs(maybe learning notes are more accurate).
